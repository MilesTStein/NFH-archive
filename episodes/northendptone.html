        <p>Having passed Faneuil Hall, we continue along the Freedom Trail through Boston's North End. The North End was split thematically - one episode focuses on race, culture, religion, how the neighborhood has changed, and how it has <em>not</em>. The other contains all the important stories that are left out of that thematic narrative. This episode is the latter. Featuring a taste-test of Brach's "Turkey Dinner" flavored candy corn. Transcript coming soon.</p>

        <h3>About the Host</h3>
        <p>Miles Taylor is a tour guide on Boston's Freedom Trail. Officially he plays the Marquis de Lafayette for the Freedom Trail Foundation, but during his COVID-19 furlough he began doing weekly episodes for a variety show on Zoom, tackling about three sites at a time. These 30-ish minute segments have been aptly titled No Fucks History, and he is often introduced as 'Boston's No Fucks Historian', a title he finds </em>highly</em> amusing. Once the content on the Freedom Trail itself has been exhausted, he plans to choose a different moment in history at random to rant about each week. He may have a baby face but he is, in fact, 25, so all that wine he drinks on camera is perfectly legal. Shush.</p>
